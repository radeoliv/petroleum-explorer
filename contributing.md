As of iteration 2, we follow specific rules as a team.

1.	**Scheduling** - Prior to each meeting, one member must provide a schedule, detailing the activities focused on
for each meeting.  This plan must be provided by e-mail, at least a day prior to the meeting, using the shared mailing list
2.	**Task Logging** - Prior to commencing working on any task, members must create a task on Kanbanflow, assuring that a time estimate exists
3.	**User Stories** - New tasks must be assigned to user stories through colours.
4.	**New Tooling** - Members wishing to add new tools must consult all of the other members prior to integration with the system.  In the event that a new technology is added and a member is not knowledgeable, explicit documentation must be provided; otherwise,
help must be arranged for the member to learn the new technology.  If a member wishes to add a new tool,
and is unable to contact all other members, the technology must not be added until all members are aware and have
been informed
5.	**Absent Members** - Late-arriving members must alert all of the other members, either via text or e-mail as soon as they are aware they will be late.  Upon arrival, one or more members of the team must allot time to provide the late member with updates on the missed information
6.	**Sharing Information** - Scrum meetings must not start without all members present
7.	**Additional Ending Scrum** - At the end of each meeting, another scrum meeting, lasting a minimum of 5 minutes, must be conducted in which members can communicate next steps in the iteration
8.	**Meeting Etiquette** - When a member is speaking during a meeting, all members must not use cell phones
9.	**Additional Scheduled Meeting Time** - For the duration of iterations 2 and 3, additional meetings shall be held on a specified time, either on Fridays, or on Saturdays at (ROOM TBA).  All members are expected to attend these additional meetings.
10.	**Seeking Help** - Members seeking help or assistance must perform some secondary research prior to asking other members about any technical issues
